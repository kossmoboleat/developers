# Get Started

To hit the ground running with Uport Connect this guide will help you get setup. If you have any questions or difficulties, head over to [Riot](https://chat.uport.me) and someone will help you out.

## Get the uPort App

uPort primarily interacts with applications by scanning QR codes. This is usually done during transactions where an identity is disclosing data, verifying previously disclosed information or sharing contacts, just to name a few.

To get started, install the latest mobile client for your smartphone: [uPort iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uport-identity-wallet-ethereum/id1123434510?mt=8) | [uPort Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uportMobile)

## Get an Application ID

Many of our guides are already setup with application identities for your convenience.  However, you will likely want to issue verifications using your own application identity.  To setup an application identity you can use web3, or you can head over to [MyApps](/myapps) to register an application identity. Once authenticated to [MyApps](/myapps), proceed and click on **Register an App**, from here, you will be guided through the process of creating and saving an application identity.

During this process, you will receive a verification on your uPort mobile app, after accepting that, the registration process will be completed.

Your application identities are tied to your Ethereum address â€“ created with the uPort mobile app. They are stored as a verification and their configuration can be viewed within the mobile device, simply click on *verification* to inspect it.

## Build

From here, the world is your oyster for building **client-side** solutions using Uport Connect.
